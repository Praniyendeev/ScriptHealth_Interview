    "Q1. Suppose that we design a deep architecture to represent a sequence by stacking self-attention layers with positional encoding. What could be issues? (paragraph format)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues for the above condition can be categorized into three different areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depth\n",
    "\t- If the dataset is small or contains a lot of variation, then the deep models tend to memorize the data and overfit\n",
    "\t- If skip connections are not implemented between the layers, the gradient during backpropagation vanishes before it reaches some of the initial layers.\n",
    "\t- On a similar note, without proper regularization, normalization, and activations, the loss might be too significant and would lead to NaN gradients\n",
    "2. Self attention\n",
    "\t- Self attention though revolutionary, requires large amounts of data(pre-training) before it can start performing significantly compared to RNNs\n",
    "\t- Self-attention can theoretically scale to Infinite sequence lengths. However, this scaling is done at the expense of quadratically increased time and space requirements.\n",
    "\t- Due to their fully connected nature, self-attention mechanisms tend to learn trivial solutions based on some inherent information.\n",
    "3. positional encoding\n",
    "\t- If the relationships between various time steps are not based simply on their relative positions, then the classic sine /cosine encoding will not be able to encapsulate these relationships and will lead to a sub-optimal model.\n",
    "\t- Positional encoding could lead to an overfit model utterly dependent on the positions and failing to learn from the data embeddings.\n",
    "\t- On the other hand, a learnable encoding that could mitigate this issue would require vast amounts of data (with many variabilities) to capture the optimal encoding accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention and positional encodings are revolutionary inventions; however, they are much more computationally expensive than RNN and CNN-based architectures. Moreover, they are also highly data-hungry. However, we can achieve close to optimal performance with transformers with suitable normalization, regularization, well-processed datasets, and custom positional information to encapsulate relationships fully.\n"
